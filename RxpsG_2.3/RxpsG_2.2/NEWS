#### RxpsG version 2.2

RXPSG introduced XPSSample name as title of the graphic window
      integrated BE/KE switch GUI
      integrated dialog window when wide_spectra name unknown

XPSFilter: moving average filter corrected
           wavelets filter corrected

XPSSurElementIdentify: bugs fixed

XPSSurveyUtility modified call to XPSSurElementIdentify.

XPSElemTable (piu' survey error)

AugerTransitions.lib 

ProcessCoreLineGui some error fixed

XPSClass just comments removed

XPSConstraintsGUI  the Link page completely restyled: now more easy to set links, ctrls to avoid errors

XPSElementTabGUI  modified routine to get multiple cursor positions

XPSZoomCurGUI   eliminated assignments in MyEnv using <<-   modified GUI with coiche of XPSSamples and corelines

XPSSampleInfoGUI save edited Sample information: bug fixed

XPSUtilities: in XPSFindXindex() XPSFindXindex() error was generated when void vectors passed to these routines. Now bug corrected. 

XPSProcess: removed error generated when add fitcomponent pressed without any position set

XPSEShiftGUI.r: fixed bug in the reset energy shift procedure.

XPSOverlayGui.r: now it is possible to readjust the intensity of a given CoreLine when comparing spectra from the same XPSSample

XPSPreferencesGUI.r: added option to set user defined X-photon energy to include Synchroton radiations

XPSMoveCompGUI.r: modified adding selection of the XPSSample

XPSSplit.r: macro revised to allow splitting files composed by an unlimited number of core-lines
           (macro tested on an XPS-Sample composed by 64 core-lines)

XPSCompare.r: new function added added to RxpsG. This function allows overlapping different core-lines
              from different XPS-Samples. For each coreline a panel is generated to compare spectra. 

XPSMoveComponents: now possible to change window dimension.

XPSVmsCorrGui.r: correction for analyzer energy transfer function error fixed

XPSRead.VMS.r: fixed error reading vamas files without Analyzer Energy Transfer Function

========================================================================================
##### RxpsG version 0.6.0
>> integrates the RxpsG using the sme name Rxps to avoid discrepancies between old and new analyzed data (graph settings)
>> integrates the Rxps0.5.5 with modified XPSprocessing.R, with additional functions for analysis, plot, annotate


##### RxpsG version 0.5.5
>> Add : XPSoverlayPlot now has the capability to switch from line to point and many combination of them.
>> Change: move the code 'plot' with mode="ov" into the XPSoverlayPlot function. Now 'plot' for XPSSample
	does only plot as panel.
>> New : XPSoverlayPlot function.



##### RxpsG version 0.5
>> Fix: plot for XPSSample did not overlay with vamas type.
>> Add: normalize intensity in plot for XPSSample 

##### RxpsG version 0.4.2
>> Add: quantification for Vamas files
>> Add: Access to reference file for Kratos instrument
>> Change: rewrite of all function to access the reference file for the two instruments (scienta, kratos)
>> Fixed : 'plot' for XPSCoreLine did not set the xlimit wider than range of x
>> Change: XPSquantify now print the sum of the concentration for each element
>> Change: Ycomponent and add it to fitComponent class
>> Change: lots of small fix to better code

##### RxpsG version 0.4.1
>> Change: small changes in XPSrecepies. Now they call the new XPSbaselineGUI interface
>> Add: Flags to manage RSF for Scienta and Kratos instruments.
>> New: XPSextract function to extract a portion from a core line trough GUI. 
>> New: XPSbaselineGUI function to add baseline with graphical interface.
>> Change: XPSbaseline does not plot anymore the results. Use the GUI version instead !!
>> Change: XPSquantify now has a variable to exclude any core line from quantification even if the baseline and/or fit are present
>> Fixed : shirley reverse when higher bgnd is at lower BE
>> Change: options for XPSremove are now lowercase and default option is "all"
>> Add   : XPSexportASCII to export data

##### RxpsG version 0.4
>> Fixed: bug in the XPSconstrain (and consequently in XPSfit) that it does not manage more than 1 link.
>> Add: to the definition of fitComponent the slot rsf. In this way any component has it's rsf.
>> Change : XPSsetRSF now sets the rsf only for the XPSCoreLine RSF slot and that is used in the case of quantification only trough the baseline definition.
>> Change: the XPSbaseline calls the XPSsetRSF and XPSaddFitComponent sets the rsf for each component.
>> Fix: many small "typo" mistakes.

##### RxpsG version 0.3
>> Add: the baseline slot has an item with the baseline class object in it
>> Change: now the baseline action is managed trough the 'baseline' package
>> Add: XPSresidualPlot function, mainly called after success with fit.
>> Add: readGenplot to manage RPL file for Genplot already processed files
>> Change: a lot of adjustments on the fit function definitions and start values. now everythings seems OK.
>> Add: XPSconstrain function does manage constrain
>> Add: avoid baseline add names to y coordinate
>> Add: function to manage param values into class fitComponent
>> Change: added a new class for fitComponent and change all code to include the new class
>> Change: the fit slot (@Fit) now has a $y item to be compatible with GENPLOT replot old files that have component but the fit is not exported.

##### RxpsG version 0.2
>> Change: the original data (Kinetic or Binding or Transmission or ... and Counts or Cps) are in the .Data slot but are transformed to Binding and cps for quantitative analysis. 
>> Change: the definition of XPSCoreLine


##### RxpsG version 0.1
Date: 2012-05-13
>> ## ADD: funzioni per cancellare Componenti, fit, baseline, regiontofit da linea di core e dal campione.
	
>> ## ADD: una funzione per creare una CoreLine dal survey ed includerla nel XPSsample. OK!

>> ## ADD: funzione che calcoli le y per le funzioni di fit e restituisca un dataframe o lista
	
>> ## ADD: assegnare una label (sequenza numerica oppure stringa) per le componenti di un fit OK!

##### Version: 0.0
Date: 2012-05-13
News: Start Release
>> Assembly of all functions already have.
